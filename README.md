## **Introduction**  

This project involved analyzing datasets and solving business challenges for a mock PwC engagement. Using **Power BI**, I developed interactive dashboards to visualize data, define KPIs, and provide strategic recommendations. These dashboards focused on three key areas: call center performance, customer retention, and gender diversity within an organization.

## **Project Tasks**

### **Task 1: Call Center Trends**  
**Objective:** Create a Power BI dashboard for a manager, highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends in call center data.  

**Methodology:**  
- Imported and cleaned the dataset using Power BI's data modeling tools.  
- Created visuals, including **quadrant charts**, to analyze call volumes and durations for agents.  
- Revised the dashboard to include missing "Agent Statistics" and incorporated best practices after reviewing model answers.  

**Outcome:**  
- Delivered an actionable dashboard enabling better understanding of agent performance and customer interaction trends.

### **Task 2: Customer Retention**  

**Objective:**  
Create a dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer churn, and provide insights and recommendations to reduce churn rates.

**Methodology:**  
- Defined critical KPIs such as **Churn Rate, Retention Rate**, and **Customer Risk Analysis**.  
- Analyzed customer data using **Power BI** to identify churn patterns and segments at risk.  
- Designed a **Customer Retention Dashboard** with visualizations to showcase insights, including churn trends, technical support issues, contract type performance, and payment method impact.  
- Wrote an **email** summarizing findings and actionable recommendations for the engagement partner to reduce churn.

**Outcome:**  
- Developed a **Power BI dashboard** that effectively visualized churn rates, key risk factors, and actionable insights.  
- Provided clear and concise **recommendations** to improve customer retention and reduce churn, including contract incentives, enhanced technical support, and targeted retention campaigns.

### **Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion**  
**Objective:** Analyze gender diversity data in executive roles and provide recommendations to improve gender balance.  

**Methodology:**  
- Defined KPIs such as **Hiring Rate, Promotion Rate, Turnover Rate, and Employee Performance Rating**.  
- Visualized disparities in gender representation using charts for promotions, job profiles, and turnover.

**Outcome:**  
- Highlighted critical areas for improving gender balance and fostering an inclusive workplace.
